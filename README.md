# TriageX_IoT
`TriageX_IoT` is an automated **forensic triage and evidence-collection tool** for IoT devices based on **OpenWrt**, such as [OWASP IoTGoat](https://github.com/OWASP/IoTGoat).   Written in **bash + python**, it extracts key artifacts, detects persistence mechanisms, exposed services, and vulnerabilities in LuCI or custom web panels.
